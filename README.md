# go-make
A little library for easily writing make/build scripts in go.
It is not a build script in itself, but a high level library for making your own go build scripts.

This project is highly inspired by [nstratos/make.go](https://github.com/nstratos/make.go).

It is fairly basic for now but maybe it will grow over time, however I will only work on it as far a I need it.
So if you like this idea and want to see any feature in this feel free to fork it and open a pull request.

# Usage

Take a look in the example folder to see how to use it.
